    <h1>Confidence</h1>

    <p>Stepping Stone Labs projects are hands-on, in the trenches work where you learn from research, experimentation, failures, and successes. You will not be passively watching some outdated video that explains things in the abstract and not in the context of real work.</p>

    <p>Working on our projects, and seeing your ideas and designs come to fruition, will give you the confidence that you can apply those skills in any situation. You will gain competencies, not useless certifications.</p>

    <h1>Networking</h1>

    <p>While having a deeper and broader skillset makes you a high-value teammate, it doesn't land you the job that you want.</p>

    <p>How would like to never have to apply for a job again?</p>

    <p>Imagine the team of your dreams needs someone new, and one of your peers mentions you as the person they <strong>must</strong> hire.</p>

    <p>Having a rich, diverse and well-developed network of peers is the greatest benefit you gain from working on projects at Stepping Stone Labs. You will be working with teams of people who are just as curious and driven as you, and likely in the same place in their careers. While they may not be hiring managers (but sometimes they are), they are definitely involved in the hiring process.</p>

    <h1>More Career Options</h1>


    <p>There are jobs that you want that require a competency that you don't have, but you have all of the others. A diverse skill set allows you to attack opportunities that other can't - with confidence.</p>

    <p>Because the projects at Stepping Stone Labs have you working across the entire spectrum of a tech stacks, and the necessary tools, you will gain a versatility of competencies that you might not ever gain on the job.</p>

    <p>You will work with cloud orchestration tools, telemetry solutions, performance enhancing strategies, message queues for event driven systems, design patters, and more. While some, or even most, of those are not your career targets, having the versatility to understand how they work and be a part of the conversation when designing systems will give you options.</p>
