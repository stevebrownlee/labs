# Stepping Stone Labs

After 30 years in the software development industry, and 10 years of building the learning experience at Nashville Software School, [Steve Brownlee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbrownlee/), founded Stepping Stone Labs as the next evolution in learning and growth for software developers.

This program was born out of a desire to empower people to grow in their career as software developers. Before Standing Stone Labs, the only structured learning environments were for beginners. University, interships, or bootcamps were your options to break into the field.

Unfortunately, from the moment you acquire your first job, you are completely on your own. As you look ahead at your new careers, you see that there is a seemingly infinite ocean of information and choices available for you.

As a novice, it is overwhelming without the proper guidance.

If you ask your community, team, or employer for guidance, you are given highly biased advice. Well intentioned, absolutely, but biases nonetheless. You also need a high risk tolerance so that you can switch jobs and not stagnate. You also need a certain amount of luck, and land on teams where you can learn new things.

We are highly skilled coaches, mentors, technologists, and educators. This unique combination of skills allow us to cut through potential biases and identify the core skills and competencies that people need to succeed and grow in their software careers.
