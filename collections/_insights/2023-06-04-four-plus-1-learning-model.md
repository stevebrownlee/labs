# Unleash Productivity: Embrace the Power of the 4+1 Learning Model

## The 4 Day Work Week

Discussion of, and experimentation with, a four-day workweek is currently underway across the country. A look at early results suggests that "time in seat" is not, and has never been, a reliable metric for productivity. When [planned for, and implemented, correctly _(A Guide to Implementing the 4-Day Workweek)_](https://hbr.org/2021/09/a-guide-to-implementing-the-4-day-workweek), it is becoming clear that knowledge workers can be just as productive in 32 hours and they can in 40 hours, while giving the organization a less stressed, more rejuvinated team that is mentally ready to solve complex problems instead of being exhausted.
