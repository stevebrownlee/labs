The **Shipping Code** workshop is a practical and hands-on training program designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This workshop is ideal for software developers, aspiring platform engineers, and anyone involved in the software delivery process who wants to learn how to efficiently ship features to customers, ensuring faster time-to-market and improved software quality.

## Key Learning Objectives

### Understanding CI/CD Concepts

Gain a clear understanding of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) principles, their benefits, and how they enable rapid feature delivery.

### Setting up CI/CD Tools and Infrastructure

Learn how to configure and deploy essential CI/CD tools and infrastructure, such as version control systems, build servers, artifact repositories, and deployment targets.

### Creating Build Pipelines

Design and implement efficient build pipelines that automate the compilation, testing, and packaging of software applications.

### Implementing Continuous Testing

Integrate automated testing frameworks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and reliability.
Enabling Continuous Deployment: Configure the pipeline to automate the deployment process, enabling rapid and controlled feature releases to production environments.
Monitoring and Rollback Strategies: Implement monitoring mechanisms and establish effective rollback strategies to mitigate risks and maintain system stability.
Best Practices for CI/CD: Learn industry best practices, such as code branching and merging strategies, code review processes, and pipeline security considerations.
Workshop Format:
Duration: 2-3 days (can be customized based on requirements)
Delivery: In-person or virtual (online)
Participants: Software developers, DevOps engineers, and individuals with basic knowledge of software development and deployment processes
