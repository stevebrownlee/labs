# Personal Coaching

If you want to invest in your career by partnering with me for some personal coaching, I would be thrilled to help you achieve your goals.

## What Is Coaching?

Coaching is an outcome focused process, with the goal being to support you to move forward confidently to the goals that you set for yourself.  My job is to facilitate your movement from where you are now to where you want to be. We will have a partnership that allows you to have control of the entire process.

You will set the intention for each session, identify your goals, and bring forward any blockages or challenges. You do this within a structure and a process provided by your coach.

## My Coaching Style

My coaching style focuses on three main factors -

1. **Curiosity and Learning** - We will approach every goal with a curious mindset to explore all possibilities and learn new strategies along the way that work for you.
2. **Honest and Direct Conversations** - Building on a foundation of trust, all of our conversations will focus on honest observations, and then directly identifying and addressing obstacles preventing you from achieving your goals.
3. **Identify and Develop Strengths** - You have strengths that are unique, and we will uncover what those are and how you can use them to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.

## Free 30-Minute Consultation

I offer a free, 30-minute consultation so that we can talk about what your needs are, and we can determine if coaching sessions are what you need to move forward. Use the calendar below to find a time for us to meet each other.
