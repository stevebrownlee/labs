### Skill Enhancement

For technologist who want to build a strong foundation of knowledge and competencies, the Ascend program guides learners through a four stage program that deepens and broadens their skills to be able to think in systems.

* Understanding how operating systems work and how to configure them.
* Understanding and implemention of common design patterns.
* Competency in event-based architectures.
* Understanding all of the constituent parts of modern CI/CD pipelines.
* Making valuable technical decisions and communicating them effectively to non-technical teammates.

### Networking and Collaboration

An integral part of this program is that each learner will be collaborating with teammates who are also curious, engaged, and positive. This will build a strong network of trusted peers that can be trusted to grow with you during your career. The shared successes and challenges as learners interact with different people on their journeys will forge strong relationships that endure.

### Leadership Development

This program has an additional, powerful effect. It will develop the leadership capabilities of each learner by helping them devise strategies for conflict resolution, defining vision, mentoring, and thinking strategically. This will enable them to take on increasingly complex and strategic roles within the organization - from senior engineer, to staff engineer, and principal engineer.

If that is the path you want to take, you must have solid technical leadership skills so that you can partner with personnel managers to keep teams producing and growing consistently.
