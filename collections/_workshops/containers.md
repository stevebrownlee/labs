## Overview

This workshop is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of containerization to create consistent environments for development and production environments. Containerization is a popular technology that has revolutionized software development and deployment. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package and run software applications. They offer a consistent and reproducible environment for developers, testers, and operators.

In this workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of containerization, including what containers are, how they work, and why they are important. You will also learn how to build and publish containers using Docker, one of the most popular containerization platforms in use today. Docker is a tool that simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing containers.

## Prerequisites

The **Terminal Velocity** workshop is recommended as a prerequisite before learning about containers. You will be building bash scripts and running many commands in the terminal in order to build and deploy containers.


## Competencies Built

The workshop will cover the following topics:

* Introduction to containerization and Docker
* Creating a Dockerfile to build a container
* Building a container using Docker build
* Running a container using Docker run
* Publishing a container to Docker Hub

By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid competency with containerization and Docker, and you will be able to build and publish your own containers. This knowledge will enable you to take advantage of containerization technology in your future software development projects.
