## Overview

Are you tired of constantly emailing code snippets back and forth or losing track of changes to your codebase? Are you using outdated tools that don't allow your development team to quickly collaborate with their code and merge it together?

Then join the giteration workshop to learn the basics of distributed version control using Git!

This workshop is designed for beginners who have little or no experience with Git or version control in general. You'll learn how to create a Git repository, use branching to work on multiple versions of your code, make commits to save your changes, merge branches back together, roll back changes when things go wrong, and more.

We'll also cover advanced topics such as patches and cherry-picking, which allow you to selectively apply changes to your codebase. By the end of the workshop, you'll have a solid understanding of how Git works and how it can help you manage your code more efficiently.

Then you will learn how to use the Github platform to collaboratively build code together.

So come Git your code together with us and take the first step towards becoming a version control master!
